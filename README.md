- 👋 Hi, I’m @AksharGoyal
- 👨‍🎓 I am currently studying at the University of Waterloo.
- 📺 I’m interested in Anime and Sci-fic or Superhero genre shows like Doctor Who and WandaVision. 
- 🌱 I consider myself a novice programmer who is always for ways to develop himself further.  
        Though I lack real-world experience, I believe if given a chance and put in the right place, I can help the people relying on my effectively.
- 💻 I’m currently learning Data Science and planning to jump from static websites to dynamic websites.
- 🧑 I’m looking to collaborate on git and C++ related projects as I believe anyone who can master them can not be affected by imposter syndrome.
